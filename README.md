# 🎥 Motion Monitor  

### 👀 Detect motion & highlight it in red!  

This is a **simple motion detection tool** built with **JavaScript and CSS**. When motion is detected in the frame, the affected area is **highlighted in red**. It's basic, but it works—and I'm proud of it! 💛  

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**  
- **JavaScript** – Detects motion & updates UI  
- **CSS** – Handles the visuals & red overlay  

---

## **⚡ How It Works**  
1️⃣ The system **analyzes** frame differences over time  
2️⃣ If motion is detected, the **moving area turns red**  
3️⃣ The rest of the screen stays **unchanged**  
4️⃣ No fancy ML models—just **pure JS magic**! ✨  

---

## **🚀 How to Run?**
1️⃣ Clone the repo  
2️⃣ Open `index.html` in your browser  
3️⃣ Move around & see the **red detection in action!** 🔴
